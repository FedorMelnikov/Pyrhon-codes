# This program needs to make use of for loops in order to display the times
# tables for any number.
# For example, say the user enters 6 - the program must print out the 6
# times table from start (1) to end (12), something like this:
# The 6 times table is:
# 6 x 1 = 6
# 6 x 2 = 12
x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
for y in range(1, 13):
        print(f"{x} * {y} = {x*y}\n")
