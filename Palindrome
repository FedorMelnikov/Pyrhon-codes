# Create a program that determines whether or not a string is a palindrome.
# ○ A palindrome is a string which reads the same backwards as
# forward. Some examples of palindromes are: racecar, dad, level and
# noon.
#
# Ask the user to enter a word and check if that word is a palindrome. If it is
# a palindrome, print out “Your word is a palindrome”. If it is not a
# palindrome, print out “Your word is not a palindrome”.
word = input("input any word: ")
word1 = word[::-1]
if word1 == word:
    print("Your word is a palindrome")
else:
    print("Your word is not a palidrome")
